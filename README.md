# MusicKeyboard
This application turns your computer keyboard into piano keyboard! You can play chords with your left hand &amp; melody with your right (and left also)!

## To play chords you need to press some of below keys with your left hand:

- A for a-moll
- C for C-dur
- D for d-moll
- X for E7 (E key is used already for melody...)
- F for F-dur
- G for G-dur

## To play melody press any keys in QWERTY row of your (physical) keyboard and some of digits:
(these keys have the same position as on a piano keyboard - look at the interactive keyboard below)

Red buttons highlight C sound on a keyboard.

PS. this app was made vary quickly just for fun (during the break from the freeCodeCamp course I was currently doing), so don't expect much ;-)
But... the day after I've improved many things, so now this works much better a lot.
Before these improvements:
- you couldn't play the same note a few times,
- there was only 1 octave,
- if some sound was in melody and in the chord at the same time, it didn't work...
