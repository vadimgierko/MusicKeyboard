# MusicKeyboard
This application turns your computer keyboard into piano keyboard! You can play chords with your left hand &amp; melody with your right!

## To play chords you need to press some of below keys with your left hand:

A for a-moll
C for C-dur
D for d-moll
E for E7
F for F-dur
G for G-dur

## To play melody you need to press some of below keys with your right hand or click these keys on the keybord on the screen:
(these keys have the same position as on a piano keyboard - look at the picture on the app screen)

6 for Gis
Y for A
7 for Ais
U for B
I for C
9 for Cis
O for D
0 for Dis
P for E
[ for F
= for Fis
] for G

PS. the code is messy, no iterations, no classes, no libraries (except Bootstrap) - needs refactoring etc., but it is because:
- it was a break from the freeCodeCamp course I was doing
- I wanted to test a few things at first
- after that I just wanted to have imediately fun and...
suddenly the app grown up & I didn't notice that ;-)

I will work on its refactoring, when will be bored ;-)
Now the most important thing is that:
- it works
- and I can improvise simple tunes with a few chords and a few notes in melody!

Try it! (check the github pages for this repository)

PS.2. The each note plays for 1.5 second, so... at the moment... you can not press the same note twice until the first sound stops play. I'll get to it later.
